# Privacy Policy for Imagine You

Markatis Development respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect through the **Imagine You** app, how we use and share that information, and your rights in relation to it. Please read it carefully to understand our practices regarding your personal data.

**Effective Date:** March 25, 2025  
**Version:** 1.0

## Who We Are

**Markatis Development** (a development entity owned and operated by Matthaios Markatis) ("we", "us", or "our") is the developer of the mobile application **"Imagine You"** (the "App"). We are based in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of UK data protection law (including the UK General Data Protection Regulation ("UK GDPR") and the Data Protection Act 2018), Markatis Development is the "data controller" of your personal data processed through the App.

**Company Name:** Markatis Development  
**Registered Address:** 123 Ash Crescent, Eckington, Sheffield, UK  
**Contact Email:** seebrasse345@gmail.com

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, please contact us using the details above.

## What Data We Collect

When you use Imagine You, we may collect and process the following types of information:

- **Google Account Information:** If you log in via Google, we collect your name and email address from your Google account. This is used to create and manage your Imagine You user profile. We do not collect your Google password (authentication is handled by Google).
- **Photos You Upload:** The App allows you to upload photos of yourself (or others, with their permission) to train AI models. These images may include personal data (for example, your likeness). We temporarily store these photos and send them to our third-party AI service for processing (see below for details). The photos you provide are only used to create your custom AI model and associated outputs for you.
- **AI Model Data:** Based on the photos you upload, an AI model is trained for you. We store information about your model (such as model files or identifiers, and any images or outputs generated by the model) to provide you with the service. This may include metadata like when the model was created and technical details of the model.
- **Device and Usage Data:** We may collect certain information about your device and how the App is used for debugging and improvement purposes. This can include device type, operating system version, unique device identifiers or installation IDs, IP address, and log information about how you interact with the App (such as features used and timestamps). We do **not** use this information to track you for advertising; it is solely for maintaining and improving the service and ensuring security.
- **Subscription and Payment Information:** Imagine You may offer premium features via a subscription. Payments are processed through a third-party payment processor (Stripe). We do not collect or store your full payment card details. We may receive and store information related to your subscription status (e.g. that you have an active subscription, the type of plan, and a transaction or customer ID) from Stripe to know that you have paid and to enable your premium features. Any personal financial information (like credit card numbers) is handled directly by Stripe and not by us.
- **Customer Support Communications:** If you contact us (for example, via email or support channels), we will collect the information you provide in that communication (such as your contact details and the content of your message) in order to assist you and resolve any issues.

We do not knowingly collect any other types of personal data. In particular, we do not ask for or intentionally collect data revealing your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, or similar sensitive information, except whatever may be evident in the photos you choose to upload (for example, your image might imply your ethnic origin). We only use your photos for the purposes described and treat them with appropriate care as they may be sensitive personal data.

## How We Use Your Data

We use the personal data we collect for the following purposes:

- **Providing and Improving the Service:** We use your Google account information to create and manage your user account, and to authenticate you when you log in. Your uploaded photos and the AI model data are used to train the AI model and generate personalized outputs (the core function of the App). We use device and usage data to ensure the App functions properly on different devices, to fix bugs, and to improve user experience.
- **AI Model Training and Generation:** The primary feature of Imagine You is to create a custom AI model based on the photos you upload. We send your photos to our AI processing service (Replicate) to train this model. The model and any images it generates are used to provide you with the results you requested (for example, AI-generated images of you). We may temporarily store your photos and model data as needed to complete the processing and allow you to retrieve your results.
- **Account and Subscription Management:** We use your information to maintain your profile and preferences within the App. If you purchase a subscription, we use your subscription and payment status information to give you access to premium features and manage your subscription (billing, renewals, etc.). (All financial processing is done by Stripe on our behalf — we handle the service access part.)
- **Customer Support:** If you reach out to us with questions or issues, we will use your contact information and any details you provide to respond to you, troubleshoot problems, and improve the service. This helps us resolve your issues effectively and learn how to make the App better.
- **Legal Compliance and Protection:** Where necessary, we may process personal data to comply with legal obligations (for example, keeping transaction records for accounting or tax purposes) or to protect our rights, users, or business (for example, to investigate misuse of the App, enforce our terms, or prevent fraud).

We do **not** use your personal data for any marketing or advertising purposes. This means we will not send you unsolicited marketing communications, nor will we share your data with third parties for marketing. We also will never sell your personal data. Additionally, we do not use your data for any kind of profiling or automated decision-making that has legal or significant effects on you (see "No Automated Decision-Making" below).

## Legal Basis for Processing

Under UK GDPR and related data protection laws, we must have a valid legal basis to process your personal data. We rely on the following legal bases:

- **Consent:** We rely on your consent to process certain personal data. In particular, when you choose to upload photos (which may include sensitive data like biometric information in your images), we process those photos and any resulting AI model or images based on your **explicit consent**. We also rely on your consent to transfer your data to our third-party AI service in the United States for processing (as described below under "International Data Transfers"). You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (see "Your Rights" below), but please note that if you withdraw consent for processing your photos or model, we will not be able to continue providing those features of the App to you.
- **Performance of a Contract:** When you create an account and use Imagine You, you enter into an agreement (the Terms of Service) with us to use the App's services. We need to process certain data to fulfill our obligations under that agreement and provide the service you expect. For example, we process your Google account name and email to establish and identify your user account, and we process your subscription status to provide the premium services you've paid for. This processing is necessary for the performance of our contract with you (under Article 6(1)(b) of the UK GDPR).
- **Legitimate Interests:** In some cases, we may process your data to pursue our legitimate interests in a way that does not override your rights and freedoms. For instance, collecting device and usage data to improve our App and ensure security is based on our legitimate interest in maintaining a reliable, effective, and secure service. Similarly, if we process certain data to prevent fraud or misuse of the App, we do so under legitimate interests. When we rely on this basis, we carefully consider and balance our interests against your privacy rights to ensure we are not being intrusive or unfair.
- **Legal Obligation:** If we are required by law to retain or disclose certain data, we will do so to comply with those legal obligations (Article 6(1)(c) UK GDPR). For example, financial regulations may require us to keep basic information about payments or transactions for a certain period for tax or accounting purposes, or we might have to disclose information if required by a valid law enforcement request.

Where we process any **special category** of personal data (such as biometric data from your photos, which could be considered data concerning your physical characteristics), we will ensure we have your explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a) UK GDPR) or another applicable legal basis under the law to process that data. We treat your uploaded images with high sensitivity and security for this reason.

## Third-Party Service Providers

To provide the Imagine You service, we use a few trusted third-party services who process data on our behalf. We share your data with them only to the extent necessary for the purposes outlined in this policy, and we ensure they protect your data through appropriate agreements and safeguards. These third parties include:

- **Google Firebase (Authentication and Firestore Database):** We use Google Firebase services (provided by Google LLC) to handle user authentication and to store data in a cloud database (Firestore). Firebase Authentication manages the Google login process, and Firestore holds your user profile information, metadata about your uploads and models, subscription status, and other data needed by the App. Firebase may process and store this data on servers located in the United States or other regions (depending on how the service is configured). Google, as our processor, is obligated to protect your data and uses security measures in line with Google’s standards. Google also participates in data transfer frameworks and uses Standard Contractual Clauses to facilitate lawful data transfers (see "International Data Transfers" below). You can review Google's general privacy practices in Google's Privacy Policy.
- **Replicate (AI Processing Service):** We use the Replicate API (offered by Replicate) to perform the AI model training and image generation. When you upload images in the App, those images are securely transmitted to Replicate's servers in California, USA for processing. Replicate uses your photos to train the model and generate outputs as instructed by us. We have an agreement with Replicate that they only process your images and data for our purposes and will not use them for anything else. They store your images and model data temporarily to complete the processing. According to our arrangement, any images and models stored by Replicate on our behalf will be deleted no later than **30 days** after we (or you) request deletion, and typically much sooner. Replicate is bound by data protection obligations to safeguard your data while they have it.
- **Stripe (Payment Processing):** We use Stripe, Inc. to handle subscription payments and in-app purchases. When you initiate a subscription or purchase, you will provide payment details (such as credit card information) through Stripe's secure payment interface. Stripe will process your payment and may store your payment details for billing and subscription management. **We do not receive or store your sensitive payment information** (e.g., full credit card number or billing address). Stripe provides us with limited information such as a payment confirmation, subscription ID, or customer ID, which we use to maintain your subscription status. Stripe may process data on servers outside the UK (including the US). Stripe is certified and/or uses Standard Contractual Clauses to ensure any data transferred out of the UK/EEA is protected. For more details, please refer to Stripe's Privacy Policy.
- **Google (Google Sign-In):** As part of using Google for authentication, you will interact with Google’s sign-in system. When you choose to "Sign in with Google," you are redirected to Google to enter your credentials. Google then shares with us your basic profile information (name, email, and a unique user ID) which we use to log you into the App. This process means Google is briefly involved in your login transaction. Your use of Google sign-in is subject to Google's own privacy policy. We do not receive your Google password or any access to your Google account beyond the basic profile info you allow.
- **Other Service Providers:** Aside from the above, we may use additional services for tasks like cloud hosting, data backup, or error reporting. If we do so, those providers will also be bound by strict data protection obligations. We do **not** currently use any third-party analytics platforms that collect personal data, nor do we integrate any advertising networks into the App.

We do not share your personal data with any third parties for their own marketing or advertising purposes, and we will never sell your personal data. All third parties that process user data for Imagine You are performing a service for us (as processors or service providers) and are bound by confidentiality and data protection agreements. They are not allowed to use your data for any purposes other than those instructed by us.

## International Data Transfers

Your personal data may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of the United Kingdom (and outside your country of residence) as part of providing our services. In particular, data handled by our third-party providers **Firebase (Google)**, **Replicate**, and **Stripe** may be processed on servers in the **United States**. For example, when you upload photos in the App, they are sent to Replicate's servers in the U.S. for processing. Similarly, our Firebase database might be hosted on U.S. servers, and Stripe may process payments using servers outside the UK.

We understand that countries outside the UK (including the U.S.) may have different data protection laws than your home jurisdiction. When we transfer your personal data internationally, we take steps to ensure your information is afforded a similar level of protection as within the UK. These safeguards include:

- **Standard Contractual Clauses:** We rely on European Commission and UK-approved standard data protection clauses in our agreements with U.S. service providers. These clauses contractually require your data to be protected to GDPR standards even when it is transferred to a country like the U.S.
- **Service Provider Commitments:** We work with companies that are reputable and have their own privacy and security measures in place. For instance, Google and Stripe adhere to industry standards and legal frameworks for data protection (such as EU-US and UK-US data transfer frameworks or equivalent measures).
- **Your Explicit Consent:** By using the Imagine You App and uploading your photos, you explicitly consent to your personal data (including images) being transferred to and processed in the United States by our service providers as explained above.

If we need to transfer your data to any other country outside the UK or European Economic Area (EEA) in the future, we will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place in accordance with data protection law and will update this Privacy Policy to keep you informed.

## Data Retention

We keep your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including providing the service to you, or as required by law. In practice, this means:

- **User Account Data:** We retain your account information (such as your name, email, and profile data) for as long as your Imagine You account is active. If you choose to delete your account or if we close the service, we will delete or anonymize your account data from our active databases, unless we are required to keep it for legal reasons. For example, if you delete your account, we may still need to keep a record of a transaction for tax purposes, but we would delete personal details not needed for that purpose.
- **Uploaded Photos:** Photos you upload are retained only as long as needed to train the AI model and provide you with the resulting outputs. Once your model is generated and we no longer need the original images for that purpose, we typically delete or archive those images. If you delete specific photos from the App or request deletion of your data, we will promptly delete those photos from our storage and will instruct our processor (Replicate) to delete any copies of those images from their servers. In any case, any images stored by Replicate on our behalf will be removed no later than **30 days** after a deletion request (and often much sooner).
- **AI Models and Generated Outputs:** The AI model created from your photos, along with any images or outputs generated for you, will be kept while your account is active so that you can continue to use them. If you delete a model or delete your account, we will delete the model and associated outputs from our systems and request the deletion from Replicate’s servers as well. We may retain minimal information about the model (for instance, an internal record that a model existed, or logs of its creation) for troubleshooting or auditing, but these records will not include the photos or the model data itself.
- **Device and Usage Logs:** General app usage logs and device data are usually kept for a limited period (for example, logs may be retained for 90 days) unless we need them longer to investigate specific issues or security incidents. We may use aggregated or anonymized data (which no longer identifies you) for analytics or service improvement, and such aggregated data may be retained longer since it does not contain personal data.
- **Subscription and Payment Information:** We keep records of your subscription status and payment transactions for as long as you are subscribed and for a reasonable period thereafter. This allows us to manage subscriptions (like re-activating premium features if you had a lapse and then returned) and to maintain accurate financial records. For example, we may retain invoice records as required by law (which can be several years under UK tax law), but these records will typically contain minimal personal information (perhaps your email or user ID and a Stripe transaction ID).
- **Customer Support Data:** Communications you send to us (emails, support messages) may be retained for a period of time to help us manage your current or future inquiries. We generally do not keep these longer than necessary — typically up to 1-2 years — unless needed for legal purposes. This helps us have context if you contact us again, and to improve our support processes.

When we no longer have a legitimate need to keep your personal data, we will securely delete or anonymize it. If complete deletion is not immediately feasible (for example, if the data is stored in a secure backup archive that is not easily editable), then we will store your data securely and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.

## Security

We take the security of your personal data seriously. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include, for example:

- **Encryption:** We use encryption to protect data in transit. For instance, when data is sent between your device and our servers (or to Replicate), it is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS). This helps prevent eavesdropping on your data while it travels over the internet.
- **Access Controls:** Data stored in our database (Firestore) and on our servers is protected by strict access controls. Only authorized personnel or service processes have access to personal data, and only on a need-to-know basis. We restrict administrative access to the systems that store personal data, and we regularly review those access privileges.
- **Security Practices of Providers:** We choose reputable service providers (Google, Replicate, Stripe) that have strong security practices. For example, Google and Stripe are known to implement industry-standard security measures for their cloud services and APIs.
- **Maintenance and Testing:** We keep our app and backend systems updated with security patches and monitor for potential vulnerabilities. We may perform security testing or audits of our systems to identify and address potential weaknesses.
- **Organizational Policies:** Any personnel or contractors who assist in developing or operating Imagine You are required to follow confidentiality and data protection agreements. We limit who has access to personal data and provide training on data security and privacy.

Despite our efforts, please note that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. You should also take care to protect your own account credentials and devices. If you believe your interaction with us or the App is no longer secure (for example, if you suspect that your account has been compromised), please notify us immediately so we can assist.

## Children's Privacy (Age Limit)

Our App is not intended for use by children. You must be at least **16 years old** to use Imagine You. We do not knowingly collect personal data from anyone under the age of 16. By using the App, you represent that you are 16 or older.

If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a person under 16, we will take prompt steps to delete such information from our records. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child under 16 has used the App or provided personal data to us, please contact us immediately. We will delete the child's information and account, if applicable.

## Your Rights

Under data protection laws, including the UK GDPR, you have certain rights regarding your personal data. These include:

- **Right to Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you, and to obtain information about how we process it. This is commonly known as a "Subject Access Request."
- **Right to Rectification:** You have the right to request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal data. If any of your information is incomplete or incorrect, we will update it. (For example, if your email changes, you can update it in the App or ask us to change it in our records.)
- **Right to Erasure:** You have the right to request that we delete your personal data. This is sometimes called the "right to be forgotten." In the Imagine You app, you have the ability to delete your AI models and uploaded photos via your profile/settings. You may also delete your entire account via the App or by contacting us. Upon such a request, we will delete your personal data from our systems (except for data we are legally required to keep, if any). We will also instruct our processors (like Replicate) to delete the data they hold on our behalf. Keep in mind that deleting your data or account means you will lose access to the App and any models or outputs you created.
- **Right to Withdraw Consent:** If we are processing your personal data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. For example, you can withdraw consent for us to use your photos by deleting them or by contacting us to remove your data. Please note that withdrawing consent will not affect the legality of any processing we carried out before you withdrew consent. However, if you withdraw consent for core data (like your photos or model), we may not be able to continue providing the related service features to you.
- **Right to Restrict Processing:** You have the right to request that we limit the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances. This could apply if you contest the accuracy of the data, or if you believe the processing is unlawful but you prefer restriction over deletion, or if we no longer need the data but you need us to keep it for a legal claim, or if you have objected to processing (see next bullet) and are awaiting verification of our grounds. When processing is restricted, we will store your data but not use it until the restriction is lifted.
- **Right to Object:** You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data in certain situations. You can object to processing that is based on our legitimate interests (see the "Legal Basis" section) if you believe it impacts your rights. Given that we do not process your data for direct marketing or profiling, the main likely reason to object would be if you disagree with processing under a legitimate interest basis. If you raise an objection, we will review it and either cease the processing or explain why we believe we have compelling legitimate grounds to continue (in line with legal requirements).
- **Right to Data Portability:** For data that you have provided to us and which we process by automated means based on your consent or in performance of a contract, you have the right to request that we provide that data to you in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format, or to transmit it directly to another provider where technically feasible. In practice, this could mean you request an export of the photos or model data you provided to Imagine You, so you could use it with another service.
- **Right to Complain:** If you have any concerns or issues with how we are handling your personal data, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority. In the UK, that is the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). You can find more information on the ICO's website (https://ico.org.uk) including how to file a complaint. If you are in another country, you can contact your local data protection authority. We would appreciate the chance to address your concerns before you approach a regulator, so please feel free to contact us directly with any complaint and we will do our best to resolve it.

To exercise any of your rights, please contact us at **seebrasse345@gmail.com** or use the contact information provided in the "Contact Us" section below. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling certain requests (to ensure that we do not disclose information to an unauthorized person). We will respond to your requests within the timeframe required by law (generally within one month, although we may extend this period by an additional two months for complex requests, in which case we will inform you of the extension and the reasons).

## No Automated Decision-Making

We do not use your personal data for any automated decision-making, including profiling, in a way that produces legal effects or similarly significant effects on you. In other words, we do not make decisions about you purely by automated means (such as algorithms or AI) that would significantly affect your rights or interests. 

The AI processing in Imagine You is user-driven and purely for your benefit (i.e., generating images and a model based on your input), and it does not involve making judgments or decisions about you as a person. All significant decisions regarding your account, access to services, or charges (if any) involve human oversight and are based on the policies stated here and in our Terms of Service.

## Cookies and Analytics

**Cookies:** The Imagine You mobile app does not use cookies. (Cookies are small text files that websites store on your browser; since Imagine You is a mobile application, it does not set or read cookies on your device.) The app itself stores data in secure storage (for example, authentication tokens or preferences) but these are not cookies and are only used to make the app functional for you.

**Analytics and Tracking:** We do not use any third-party analytics or advertising trackers in the app that would follow your activity across different apps or websites. We value your privacy and have chosen not to integrate tools like Google Analytics or ad networks into the Imagine You app. We do gather basic usage information through our servers and service providers in order to monitor the performance of the service and understand how features are used (for example, Firebase provides us with aggregated metrics like number of active users, and we may log events like "model created" to monitor functionality). However, this information is collected in an anonymized or aggregated form, and it is used solely for the purpose of improving the app and fixing issues. It is not used to profile you or target you for advertising.

If you visit our website (e.g., **www.markatis.com**), that site may use necessary cookies or similar technologies for its functionality (such as to remember your preferences or to facilitate contact forms). We do not use advertising or analytics cookies on our website without your consent. Any use of cookies on the website would be detailed in a separate cookies notice or in this policy if applicable. This Privacy Policy is focused on the Imagine You app and the data it collects.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we update the policy, we will change the "Effective Date" at the top of this document. If the changes are significant, we may also notify you through the App (for example, via a notification or pop-up) or by email, so that you are aware of the changes.

We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your data. If we make material changes, we may ask for your consent where required by law. In any case, if you continue to use Imagine You after the updated Privacy Policy has been posted, we will take that to mean you have read and accepted the changes.
