# Deployment Documentation

This document outlines the fixes that were made to ensure successful deployment to Vercel.

## Fixes Applied

### ESLint Configuration

1. Created a custom ESLint configuration in `.eslintrc.json` to handle React Three Fiber properties:
   ```json
   {
     "extends": "next/core-web-vitals",
     "rules": {
       "react/no-unknown-property": ["error", { 
         "ignore": [
           "position", "args", "transparent", "blending", "attach", "array", 
           "count", "itemSize", "sizeAttenuation", "vertexColors", "depthWrite",
           "depthTest", "flatShading", "roughness", "metalness",
           "emissive", "color", "intensity", "rotation", "castShadow", "receiveShadow",
           "fog", "toneMapped", "points"
         ]
       }],
       "semi": ["error", "always"]
     }
   }
   ```

2. Added semicolons to all files using the ESLint fix command:
   ```bash
   npx eslint --fix "**/*.{ts,tsx}"
   ```

### TypeScript Fixes

1. Added custom type declarations for Three.js components in `components/three/types.d.ts`:
   ```typescript
   // Add custom type declaration for Trail component from @react-three/drei
   declare module '@react-three/drei' {
     export interface TrailProps {
       width?: number;
       length?: number;
       color?: string | number;
       attenuation?: (width: number) => number;
       target?: React.MutableRefObject<THREE.Object3D>;
       points?: Vector3[];
     }
     
     export const Trail: React.FC<TrailProps>;
   }
   ```

2. Fixed event handler types in `ParticleEffect.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const handlePointerDown = (e: { stopPropagation: () => void }) => {
     if (isInteractive) {
       e.stopPropagation();
       isDragging.current = true;
     }
   };
   ```

### Vercel Configuration

Created a `vercel.json` file with appropriate configuration:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "next build",
  "ignoreCommand": "npx eslint --quiet .",
  "devCommand": "next dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "outputDirectory": ".next",
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true
    }
  },
  "github": {
    "silent": false,
    "autoJobCancelation": true
  }
}
```

## Remaining Warnings

There are still some ESLint warnings in the codebase, but these are non-critical and won't prevent deployment:

1. Unused variables and imports
2. React hooks dependencies that could be optimized
3. Missing dependencies in useEffect hooks

These could be addressed in future updates if desired, but they don't affect the functionality of the application.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy to Vercel:

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository
2. Create a new project in Vercel
3. Connect to the GitHub repository
4. Use the default build settings (which will use our vercel.json configuration)
5. Deploy

The deployment should now succeed without the previous errors.
